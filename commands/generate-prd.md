description: Generate a comprehensive PRD document from client input file
argument-hint: Path to client answer file (e.g., /path/to/client-answers.md or .pdf or .txt)
---

You are a PRD (Product Requirement Document) generator. Your task is to create a comprehensive PRD document based on the client input file containing answers to the questionnaire.

---

## Workflow Overview

1. Read and validate input file
2. Analyze client answers
3. Check for existing PRD (ask update vs new)
4. Generate PRD document
5. Validate PRD against input (1:1 verification)
6. Generate additional questions list
7. Ask user about UX analysis
8. (If yes) Generate UX flow improvements
9. Save file and report results

---

## Step 1: Read and Validate Input File

Read the file path from `$ARGUMENTS`.

**Supported formats**: .md, .pdf, .txt, or any text-based file

**Validation checks**:
1. File path is provided
2. File exists and is readable
3. File is not empty

**If validation fails**, output error and stop:
```
Error: [specific error message]
Usage: /generate-prd /path/to/client-answers.md
```

---

## Step 2: Analyze Client Answers

Parse the client answer file and extract information for each question category:

### 2.1 Basic Information
- App Name (CRITICAL - required for file naming)
- App Type (Web / App / Dashboard)
- Deadline
- User Types and their roles/permissions
- User Relationships (1:1, 1:N, independent)

### 2.2 Design Reference
- Reference apps and points to reference
- Unique selling points / differentiators
- Preferred main color
- Preferred font

### 2.3 Features
- Main features per user type
- Main feature module flows (Actor -> Action -> Result)
- Authentication method (login, signup fields)
- Communication features (chat, video call, push notifications)

### 2.4 Data
- Data to collect (forms, surveys, logs)
- Data to export (CSV downloads)

### 2.5 Technical
- 3rd party integrations
- Domain terminology

### 2.6 Other
- Additional important information

**For missing or unclear items**: Mark as "TBD - Client confirmation needed" AND add to the Additional Questions section.

---

## Step 3: Check for Existing PRD

After extracting the App Name:

1. Check `.claude-project/prd/` directory for existing PRD files matching the app name
2. If found, ask user:
   ```
   Existing PRD found: [filename]
   Would you like to:
   1. Update the existing PRD (changes will be logged)
   2. Create a new PRD
   ```
3. If updating: Load existing PRD content for comparison and change tracking
4. If creating new: Proceed with fresh PRD generation

## Step 5: Validate PRD Against Input (1:1 Verification)

After generating the PRD, perform validation against the input file:

### 5.1 User Types Verification (CRITICAL)
- [ ] All user types from input are included in Part 1 User Types
- [ ] Each user type's permissions are accurately reflected
- [ ] User relationships (1:1, 1:N) are correct
- [ ] **Part 2 Section Mapping**: All user types (except Admin) have separate sections in Part 2
- [ ] Each user type section has Navigation Menu and Page Architecture defined

### 5.2 Feature Verification
- [ ] All main features from input are included in PRD
- [ ] Module flows match the input file
- [ ] Navigation menu structure matches input

### 5.3 Authentication Verification
- [ ] All login methods are included (ID/PW, OAuth types, etc.)
- [ ] Signup required/optional fields are correct
- [ ] Social login options are all included (Apple, Google, Kakao, etc.)

### 5.4 Tech Stack Verification
- [ ] All 3rd party APIs/integrations are included
- [ ] Platforms (iOS, Android, Web) are correct
- [ ] Backend tech stack is correct

### 5.5 Terminology Verification
- [ ] All domain terms from input are in Terminology section
- [ ] Terms are used consistently throughout the PRD

### 5.6 Screen/Page Verification
- [ ] All screens mentioned in input are included in PRD
- [ ] Each screen's components (items) are included without omission
- [ ] Both key screens and basic screens are reflected

### 5.7 Feature Update Verification (When Updating Existing PRD - CRITICAL)

When updating an existing PRD with new input:

- [ ] **Feature Replacement Check**: Does new input replace existing features?
  - Example: "My Collection" → "Art Feed" - replace all My Collection content with Art Feed
  - Old feature name should be completely replaced with new feature name
- [ ] **Feature Extension vs Replacement**:
  - Replacement: Existing feature completely changes to new feature
  - Extension: New details added to existing feature
- [ ] **Navigation Menu Update**: Update navigation menu when feature names change
- [ ] **Terminology Sync**: New feature names reflected in Terminology
- [ ] **Change Log Recording**: Record all changes in "Feature Change Log" section

### Feature Update Rules:
1. **New input takes priority**: New document content takes priority over existing PRD
2. **Explicit replacement**: If different feature is specified at same location (e.g., Home Tab), treat as replacement
3. **No arbitrary additions**: Do not add details not in the input document
4. **Document changes**: Record change history in PRD's "Feature Change Log" section

### PRD Writing Principles (CRITICAL - Must Follow):

#### 1. Reference Only Input Resources
- **No re-referencing old PRD**: When updating PRD, do not reference previously written PRD content
- **Use only new input file**: Base PRD only on PDF, documents, images provided by user
- **No accumulation**: If previous PRD details are not in new input file, delete or move to question list

#### 2. Handling Ambiguous Items
- **No guessing**: Never guess content not specified in input file
- **All ambiguous items → Question list**: If even slightly unclear, don't write in PRD, add to question list
- **Empty sections allowed**: If no information, mark as "TBD - Client confirmation needed"

#### 3. Source Tracking
- **All content must be traceable**: Every feature/screen/flow in PRD must be traceable to input file source
- **Content without source = Delete**: Content that cannot cite a source should not be included in PRD

#### Example:
```
Wrong:
- Keep "Collection Detail Page" because it was in previous PRD
- Add "read receipts, reply feature" when PDF only says "DM feature"

Correct:
- No mention of "Collection Detail Page" in new PDF → Delete or move to question list
- PDF only says "DM feature" → Write only "DM feature", add details to question list
  - Question: "DM feature details - Read receipts? Reply enabled? Notification method?"
```

### Validation Result Handling:
1. **If omissions found**: Immediately fix PRD
2. **If inconsistencies found**: Fix PRD based on input file
3. **If ambiguous**: Add to Additional Questions list

### Validation Complete Output:
```markdown
## Validation Results

### Modified Items
- [Item 1]: [Before] → [After]
- [Item 2]: [Before] → [After]

### Validation Complete
- Total items verified: [N]
- Items modified: [N]
- Items moved to questions: [N]
```

---

## Step 6: Generate Additional Questions

When generating the question list, include ALL unclear features:

### Question Generation Rules (CRITICAL):

1. **Feature details undefined**: Only feature name exists, no detailed behavior
   - Example: "DM feature" → "DM notification method? Read receipts? Reply enabled?"

2. **Data flow undefined**: Unclear where data flows from/to
   - Example: "Share Collection" → "URL format when sharing? Non-member access allowed?"

3. **Conditions/branches undefined**: Unclear behavior under specific conditions
   - Example: "Recognition Fail" → "How many seconds until fail? Retry limit?"

4. **UI/UX details undefined**: Unclear screen component behavior
   - Example: "Artist Page Stats" → "Clicking Followers shows list? Or just number?"

5. **Permissions/access undefined**: Unclear who can access what features
   - Example: "Delete Comment" → "Author only? Artist too? Admin only?"

6. **External integration undefined**: Unclear 3rd party integration details
   - Example: "Kakao Login" → "What profile info to retrieve? Friend list?"

---

## Step 7: Ask About UX Analysis

After completing the PRD and validation, ask the user:

```
PRD generation complete. Would you like to include UX flow analysis?

This will analyze:
- Navigation flow issues
- User journey optimization
- Information architecture
- Common UX problem patterns

[Yes] / [No]
```

If user selects **Yes**, proceed with UX analysis below.
If user selects **No**, skip to Step 9.

---

## Step 8: UX Flow Analysis (If Requested)

### 8.1 Navigation Flow Verification
- [ ] Back/close available from all pages?
- [ ] No dead-end pages? (pages with nowhere to go)
- [ ] Deep depth screens (3+ levels)? → Suggest shortcuts
- [ ] Frequently used features require too many tab changes?

### 8.2 User Journey Verification
- [ ] Steps to reach core features appropriate? (recommend 3 or less)
- [ ] Clear path to new user's first success (Aha moment)?
- [ ] Recovery path when errors occur?
- [ ] Clear next action from empty states?

### 8.3 Information Architecture Verification
- [ ] Related features grouped in same area?
- [ ] Same feature not scattered across multiple places?
- [ ] Structure matches user mental model?

### 8.4 Common UX Problem Patterns
1. **Orphan Pages**: Important pages with only one access path
   - Suggestion: Add multiple entry points
2. **Hidden Features**: Core features hard to discover
   - Suggestion: Guide in onboarding or adjust placement
3. **Broken Flows**: Need to navigate away mid-task
   - Suggestion: Inline handling or change to modal
4. **Excessive Confirmations**: Too many unnecessary confirmation steps
   - Suggestion: Consolidate steps or add skip option
5. **Context Loss**: Data loss when going back
   - Suggestion: Auto-save or confirmation dialog

### Improvement Suggestion Rules:
- Content not in input file → Mark as **suggestion** (no arbitrary additions)
- Show priority: High (core feature related) / Medium (convenience) / Low (nice-to-have)
- Show implementation complexity: Simple / Medium / Complex
- State rationale: Why it's a problem, which users are affected

## Step 9: Save File and Report

### 9.1 Create Output Directory
```bash
mkdir -p .claude-project/prd
```

### 9.2 Save File
Filename format: `[AppName]_PRD_[YYMMDD].md`
- Sanitize app name: Replace spaces with underscores, remove special characters
- Example: `ActivityCoaching_PRD_260112.md`

Location: `.claude-project/prd/`

### 9.3 Report Results
```markdown
## PRD Generation Complete

### Output
- File: `.claude-project/prd/[filename].md`
- Mode: [New / Update]

### Summary
- Sections included: [list]
- Validation: [N] items verified, [N] modified
- Additional questions: [N] items
- UX suggestions: [N] items (or "Skipped")

### Next Steps
1. Review the Additional Questions section
2. Send questions to client for clarification
3. Update PRD with client responses using `/generate-prd` again
```
